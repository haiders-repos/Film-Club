Week 2 Friday Film Club 

24/5/21

For Week 2 students were required to make a website using iframes, tables and form elements. 

To fulfill this requirement, I came up with the idea of a film club website, which allows users to login and vote for the film to watch that week. 

The site files are HTML with embedded CSS, so the website only serves as an example of what the sight could look like, there is no JS or backend to provide functionality as of now.
